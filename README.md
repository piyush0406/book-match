# Book Match User Interface
## Overview:
This ReactJS-based User Interface (UI) is designed for users to provide answers on a scale of 1 to 5, with a fixed navigation bar, a user input section featuring sliders, and visual results presented in a modal. The UI aims to be user-friendly, intuitive, and visually appealing.

## Components:
#### Fixed Navigation Bar:
* Positioned at the top for easy access.
* Contains navigation links or icons for different sections of the application.
* Remains fixed as the user scrolls for constant accessibility.
#### User Input Section:
* Utilizes sliders for users to select answers on a scale of 1 to 5 for three questions.
* Each slider is labeled to indicate the corresponding question.
* Styled for clarity and ease of use.
#### Visual Results Modal:
* A modal that dynamically displays the visual representation of results.
* The modal appears upon user interaction or submitting answers.
* React state or state management is used to update and reflect changes in real-time.
## Styling and Design:
#### Color Palette:
* Choose a color palette that aligns with the application's theme or your preferred style.
* Consider using different colors to distinguish between elements like sliders, buttons, and modal backgrounds.
#### Typography:
* Select readable fonts to ensure a pleasant reading experience.
* Use contrasting font styles for headings, subheadings, and body text.
#### Layout:
* Employ a responsive layout to ensure the UI is accessible across various devices.
* Use modern layout techniques for a visually appealing design.
#### Visual Elements:
* Integrate visual elements such as icons, images, or illustrations to enhance the UI.
* Ensure a balance between aesthetics and functionality.
## Usage:
#### Answering Questions:
* Slide the sliders to select answers on a scale of 1 to 5 for each question.
#### Viewing Results:
* Visual results will be dynamically updated and displayed in a modal upon submitting answers.
## Getting Started:
### Installation:
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Run **npm install** to install dependencies.
### Run the Application:
* Execute **npm start** to run the development server.
* Open the application in your web browser.


# Backend rate_book_handler Function
### Overview:
The rate_book_handler function is a backend API handler designed to handle requests related to book rating or matching based on user responses to three questions (ans1, ans2, ans3). The function calculates a "difference" metric between user responses and book attributes, sorting books by this metric and returning the top 3 matches.

### Endpoint:
**Endpoint: /rate_book**  
**Method:** POST  

#### Request Body:  

* The function expects a JSON payload in the request body with the following properties:

```
ans1: A numeric value representing the user's response to the first question.
ans2: A numeric value representing the user's response to the second question.
ans3: A numeric value representing the user's response to the third question.
```
### Example:

``` ruby
{
    "ans1": 5,
    "ans2": 3,
    "ans3": 2
}

```
### Response:
####  Success Response (200 OK):  
* The function returns a JSON object containing an array of matched books.
```
{
    "matched_books": [
        {
            "book": "Matched Book 1",
            "author": "Author 1",
            "img_link": "http://example.com/image1.jpg"
        },
        {
            "book": "Matched Book 2",
            "author": "Author 2",
            "img_link": "http://example.com/image2.jpg"
        },
        {
            "book": "Matched Book 3",
            "author": "Author 3",
            "img_link": "http://example.com/image3.jpg"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Error Response (400 Bad Request):

* In case of any errors during execution, the function returns a JSON object with an error property.
```
{
    "error": "Description of the error."
}
```
### Algorithm:
#### Database Connection:
Establishes a connection to the MongoDB database using the ConnectToDatabase helper function.
#### Data Retrieval:
Retrieves the necessary data from the "books" collection of the "reach-best-project" database.
#### Matching Algorithm:
* Utilizes the MongoDB Aggregation Framework to calculate a "difference" metric for each book based on user responses and book attributes (**adventurousness, openness_to_experience, optimism**).  
* The aggregation pipeline includes three **$pow** stages for calculating the squared differences and a **$add** stage for summing them.  
* The **$project** stage defines the fields to include in the result, including the calculated diff field.  
* The **$sort** stage sorts the documents by the diff field in ascending order.
* The **$limit** stage limits the result set to the top 3 matched books.
#### Sorting and Limiting:
Sorts the books based on the calculated difference metric in ascending order.
Limits the result set to the top 3 matched books.
#### Response:
Sends a JSON response containing the array of matched books.
##### Error Handling:
Any errors encountered during the execution of the function are logged and result in a 400 Bad Request response with an error message.
##### Dependencies:
The function depends on an external ConnectToDatabase helper function, presumably for establishing a connection to the MongoDB database.
##### Note:
This documentation assumes the existence of a MongoDB database named "reach-best-project" and a collection named "books" with relevant attributes like "adventurousness," "openness_to_experience," "optimism," etc. Ensure that the database and collection names align with the actual implementation.
##### Example Usage:
```
// Example usage in a route handler
import { rate_book_handler } from "./path-to-rate-book-handler";

app.post("/rate_book", rate_book_handler);
```
